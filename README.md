# Asteriods
My version of the populer asteroids game. 👌🏽

## Description

Can't believe I have to explain Asteroids, but yeah, it's one of the first video games made. The Idea is pretty simple, you are in a spaceship armed with a canon, with only one job, shooting asteroids. You stay in the game by not getting hit by one.
